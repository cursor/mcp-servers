# Contributing to MCP servers

This repository maintains a curated collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for developer tools and services.

## What we're looking for

Accepted MCP servers provide value to developers:

- Version control systems, code review tools, and CI/CD platforms
- Cloud hosting, deployment, and infrastructure management services
- Databases and data analytics platforms
- API documentation, testing, and monitoring tools
- Security scanners and authentication services
- Issue tracking and project collaboration platforms
- Knowledge bases, wikis, and documentation generators

## How to contribute

### Request a server

Submit MCP servers via the [Server Request Template](https://github.com/cursor/mcp-servers/issues/new?template=server-request.yml). All technical integration and testing is handled for you.

This collection is curated. Servers must be useful to developers and work with professional development tools.

To help prioritize what gets added next, upvote existing requests.

## Requirements

- Valid MCP server with proper protocol implementation
- Actively maintained and publicly available
- Clear installation and usage documentation
- Solves real development problems
- Professional presentation and reliable implementation

## What we don't accept

- Personal projects without broad appeal
- Submissions not relevant to developers or professional development workflows
- Consumer-focused applications
- Duplicates of existing servers

## Review process

1. Review against criteria
2. Test functionality
3. Add to collection

We process requests as fast as possible, but can't promise any timeline.
